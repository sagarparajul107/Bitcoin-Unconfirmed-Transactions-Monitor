# Bitcoin Unconfirmed Transactions Monitor 
## Overview
**This application monitors unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions using the Blockchain API, providing real-time information about ongoing transactions. It is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.**

# Demo Proposal
**This application serves educational purposes, demonstrating how to interact with APIs and build a simple GUI monitoring tool. It showcases how to fetch data from a public API and present it in an interactive format.** 

**Disclaimer: This code is intended for educational purposes only. You should not use it for any illegal activities or to engage in unauthorized access to blockchain data. The authors of this application do not take any liability for any misuse of this software.**

# Features
**Displays real-time unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions.**
**User-friendly graphical interface.**
**Easy to use and understand.**
**Requirements**
**Python 3.x**
**Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)**
**requests library (can be installed with pip)**
# Installation
## Step 1: Install Python
**Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org**

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries
**Open your terminal or command prompt and install the requests library if not already installed:**

## CopyReplit
(pip install requests)
# How to Run the Application
## On Windows
**Open the Command Prompt (cmd).**
**Navigate to the directory where your Python script (verfy.py) is located.**
## CopyReplit
(cd path\to\your\directory)
**Run the application using Python:**
## CopyReplit
(python verfy.py)
# On Termux (Android)
**Install Python and required packages in Termux:**

## CopyReplit
(pkg install python)
(pkg install python-pip)
(pip install requests)
**Install the Tkinter library if your version of Python supports it (you may need to install additional packages based on your environment):**

## CopyReplit
(apt install python3-tkinter)
**Note: The graphical interface may not work well on Termux; consider using a CLI for better interaction.**

**Navigate to the directory where your Python script** (verfy.py) **is located, and run:**

## CopyReplit
(python verfy.py)
# On Kali Linux
## Open a terminal window.
**Update your package manager and install Python and pip:**
## CopyReplit
(sudo apt update)
(sudo apt install python3 python3-pip)
**Install the requests library:**
## CopyReplit
(pip3 install requests)
# Ensure Tkinter is installed:
## CopyReplit
(sudo apt install python3-tk)
**Navigate to the directory where your Python script** (verfy.py) **is located:**
CopyReplit
(cd /path/to/your/directory)
## Run the application:
## CopyReplit
(python3 verfy.py)
Usage
**Once the application starts, it will display real-time unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions, updating the information every few seconds. The interface will present transaction details such as Hash, Amount (in BTC), Time, and Confirmations.**

# Troubleshooting
**If you encounter an error related to Tkinter, ensure that it is installed correctly on your system.** 
**For any issues related to the API, check the API's accessibility and your internet connection.**

# Notes:
**Running in Termux: The GUI feature of Tkinter might not work as expected in Termux, as it is primarily designed for terminal-based applications. You might consider using a headless version or adapting it to a command-line interface.**

# API Limitations: Ensure you handle the API's rate limiting correctly and consider implementing error handling to deal with network issues or API downtimes.
